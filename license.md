License:
If you are a developer, and you want to change the source for your own personal benefit or for a company website you are working on,
then just go ahead and fork it and change it. That's totally fine. We don't care. Use your own version on a gazillion websites.
If you change it and have to republish on github then it must have the word "causejs" in the name of the repository and the product.
And copy this license completely in there too.

However, we have a slightly different kind of license if you are a corporation, business, browser developer or someone trying to copy us,
take our ideas, or make money from this or a derivative product. For you guys we have full copyright over this material and you cannot
copy it, take our ideas, reverse-engineer it, republish and sell, etc. etc. without our explicit permission.
We retain full rights per the EULA on our website.
