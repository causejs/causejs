General use:
Go ahead and download and use as you like on as many websites as you like. The language and the Elements extension are free, and that is not ever going to change, and these will continue to evolve.

Having at the commands:
You can build your own commands and submit them for integration or to make externally available.
If you build commands that you want to be part of the official core, let us know through the support form on our website (https://causejs.org/support.html).
We will be setting up an alternative language library. We have a credits page waiting!

Having at the ideas:
If you get a Eureka moment concerning a possible Cause syntax or language improvement and want to contribute in this way, you can let us know via the support form on the website.

Having at the core:
Due to the complexity of having to integrate the core with both the extensions, and not wanting to spend all our time reviewing code, we're going to keep the development of the core and extensions in-house.
But if you have an un-minifier and fancy a challenge, you can fork it and mod the core yourself to your heart's content for use on your own or your company's websites.
You are allowed to reverse-engineer and hack the core around and republish in any form on github, but only if you put the word "causejs" in the title of the project.
You are not allowed to integrate it into any browser internals in any form without our explicit consent. We are open to negotiation on this.
Any bug fixes in the official core or extensions should be reported to us on our support form so they can be fixed rapidly.
