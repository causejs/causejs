# Cause JS
Cause JS - the JavaScript framework that looks like CSS.

The first JavaScript framework of the 20s!

Cause JS is the first, truly 100% declarative programming language for the browser.

It comes with Chrome DevTools extensions for real-time event editing and monitoring.

Faster startup than the popular frameworks, and weighing in at 15KB with brotli compression.

It is also fully extendable, so you can create your own language if you don't like the built-in commands.

```
#clickMe:click {
    alert: "Hello world!";
}
```

It works on modern browsers of the last couple of years. It won't work on IE and older browsers, and it is probably not worth polyfilling as it relies on the speed of today's querySelectorAll for its power.

You can fork it and mod the core to your hearts content for use on websites, so to that extent it is open-source, and you can republish the core with your own language, but only if you include the word "causejs" in the title.

If you build commands that you want to be part of the official core, let us know through the support form on our website (https://causejs.org/support.html), and we will set up an alternative language library, or include your commands in the core and give you a credit, something like that. We haven't worked it out yet.
