# causejs
Cause JS - the JavaScript framework that looks like CSS.

I'm just having to sort out the syntax highlighting myself for the docs website on the backend, rather than the front-end as previously planned and then it's going live. If you want something done... Dunno why I'm writing this. Like there's an actual audience or something.

Release date: Close to new year 2019.
